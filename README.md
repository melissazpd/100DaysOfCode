## Day 1

Feb 14 2022

I wanted to do some CSS art, so for Valentine’s day I embarked on doing a bouncing heart. I got stuck when I tried to bounce the shapes, but the @keyframes would override the rotation, so for a while I had a heart that was bouncing on the side.

I finally found some advice to nest the divs. The inner div would have the shape and the outside div would have the animation and it worked!

I want to mess with shadows, but because the heart is made up of two circles and two squares, all my attempts today made my heart look like a butt. Not exactly what I was going for, so I’ll try again another day.

## Day 2

Feb 15, 2022

I started watching [Traversy Media’s JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners](https://youtu.be/hdI2bqOjy3c) to preview for Thursdays #100Devs class.

Hindsight is 20/20 because I feel like I didn't have enough time for the homework assigned for class, but I did work on the layouts that are due on Thursday. It’s mostly HTML and CSS work. I am using floats the first time around because Leon would like us to know how to work floats in case we need to work on legacy code, but I would like to redo the layout using Flexbox in the future.
