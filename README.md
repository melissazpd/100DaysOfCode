## Day 1

Feb 14 2022

I wanted to do some CSS art, so for Valentine’s day I embarked on doing a bouncing heart. I got stuck when I tried to bounce the shapes, but the @keyframes would override the rotation, so for a while I had a heart that was bouncing on the side.

I finally found some advice to nest the divs. The inner div would have the shape and the outside div would have the animation and it worked!

I want to mess with shadows, but because the heart is made up of two circles and two squares, all my attempts today made my heart look like a butt. Not exactly what I was going for, so I’ll try again another day.
